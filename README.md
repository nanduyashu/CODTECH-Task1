2. **Content Planning:**
   Developed a detailed 30-day posting schedule including:

   * **Post Types:** Brand stories, user-generated content (UGC), behind-the-scenes, product highlights, fun facts, challenges, event promotions, and sustainability posts.
   * **Captions:** Short, catchy, on-brand messages incorporating emojis and a youthful tone to drive engagement.
   * **Hashtags:** Curated a mix of branded, trending, and theme-based hashtags to improve visibility and reach.
   * **Image/Visual Ideas:** Suggested creative visuals such as vintage ads, lifestyle shots, animated product reveals, and fan submissions.

3. **Thematic Organization:**
   Ensured each week followed a theme (e.g., nostalgia, sustainability, community moments, health & wellness) to maintain consistency and audience anticipation.

4. **Engagement Strategy:**
   Included calls to action like “tag a friend,” “share your story,” and “join the challenge” to boost interaction and encourage UGC.

   Structured the calendar in an easy-to-follow Excel sheet, clearly listing:

   * Dates
   * Post Types
